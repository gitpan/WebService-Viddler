WebService-Viddler

Similar to YouTube and Vimeo, Viddler is a web application, built around videos, that allows one to upload and share on the web.

Viddler also provides a great deal of features for customization, from customizing of the video player to the integration of the Viddler platform into a specific application. The obvious advantage here for a business or organization is the ability to provide video content wrapped within their own branding or application without the expense of building and managing the huge computing infrastructure required for bandwidth and data storage.

This module wraps around Viddler's API. The goal here is not only to provide a basic how-to, but a quick method for integrating Perl-based applications with Viddler.

At the moment this module is undergoing rapped development. Not all methods that this module wraps have been tested and verified. As such, at this time please consider this module Alpha quality code. If considering use in a production environment, be sure to rigorously test and validate the implementation of this code against the expected behavior as outlined in Viddler's API documentation: http://developers.viddler.com/documentation/api/
